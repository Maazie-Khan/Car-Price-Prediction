# Car-Price-Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. Below are the steps involved in the process:

# Car Data
The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars including features like make, model, year, mileage, etc.
# Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
# Data Transformation
Necessary transformations were applied to the data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.
# Price Distribution
The distribution of car prices is left-skewed, indicating a higher concentration of lower-priced cars.
# Visualization
Bar graphs and box plots were created to visualize the relationship between categorical features and car prices.
Scatter plots were utilized to explore the correlation between continuous features and car prices.
# Feature Analysis
Analyzed which columns have a significant impact on car prices.
Conducted feature engineering using one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables.
# Feature Selection
Employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlation techniques for feature selection.
# Linear Regression
Implemented a basic linear regression model for price prediction.
# Model Evaluation
Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the training data and 82% on the test data, indicating good predictive performance.
# Errors 
were closely examined to ensure model robustness and accuracy.
